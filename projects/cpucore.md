# RISC-V CPU Core SystemVerilog

Part of a university course where we were instructed to build a CPU from scratch. We needed to implement the RV32I base instruction set, minus the fence instruction. It was expected that it would compile to a real FPGA, and pass a serious of tests given as C programs. We were also told that it would need to be pipelined and have a minimum IPC.

Involved learning the RISC-V instruction set, including making my own tests. As well I learnt about the Fetch-Decode-Execute-Writeback CPU cycle.
